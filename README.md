# Car Rental Service Platform

The Car Rental Service Platform is a modern web application built on the MERN stack, designed to streamline the vehicle rental process. This platform offers a secure user authentication system, real-time vehicle booking management, and an intuitive interface for customers to browse and reserve vehicles. The integration of JWT-based authentication and MongoDB ensures robust data management while maintaining a seamless user experience.

Leveraging React's component-based architecture for the frontend and Express.js's powerful routing capabilities for the backend, the platform provides essential features such as user registration, vehicle reservation management, and booking history tracking. The system's architecture emphasizes scalability and security, implementing features like secure password hashing, token-based authentication, and efficient database queries to deliver a reliable and user-friendly car rental solution.
